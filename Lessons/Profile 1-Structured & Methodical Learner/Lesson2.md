## Lesson 1.2: Writing Expressions with Variables

**1. Definition: What is an Algebraic Expression?**

*   An **algebraic expression** is a mathematical phrase that can contain:
    *   Numbers (constants like 3, 7, 10.5)
    *   Variables (like `x`, `y`, `t`)
    *   Operation symbols (like `+` for addition, `-` for subtraction, `×` for multiplication, `÷` for division)
*   **Important Note:** An expression does *not* have an equals sign (`=`). When an equals sign is present, it becomes an equation.

**2. Translating Words into Algebraic Expressions:**

A key skill in Algebra is to translate word problems or phrases into mathematical expressions. Let's look at common keywords:

| Operation      | Keywords                                       | Example Phrase        | Algebraic Expression |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| **Addition**   | Plus, sum, increased by, more than, added to   | 5 more than a number `n` | `n + 5`              |
| **Subtraction**| Minus, difference, decreased by, less than     | A number `y` minus 3   | `y - 3`              |
|                |                                                | 7 less than a number `k` | `k - 7` (Order matters!)|
| **Multiplication**| Times, product, multiplied by, of (with fractions/percentages) | The product of 4 and `x` | `4x` (or `4 × x`)   |
| **Division**   | Divided by, quotient, ratio of                 | A number `b` divided by 2 | `b / 2` (or `b ÷ 2`) |

**3. Examples of Writing Expressions:**

*   **Phrase:** "A number `x` increased by 10."
    *   **Expression:** `x + 10`
*   **Phrase:** "The product of 7 and a number `y`."
    *   **Expression:** `7y`
*   **Phrase:** "9 less than a number `c`."
    *   **Expression:** `c - 9`
*   **Phrase:** "The sum of a number `a` and a number `b`, divided by 3."
    *   **Expression:** `(a + b) / 3` (Parentheses are important for order of operations)

**4. Evaluating Simple Expressions (Substitution):**

If we know the value of the variable, we can "evaluate" the expression to find its numerical result.
*   *Example:* Evaluate the expression `x + 5` if `x = 3`.
    *   Substitute `3` for `x`: `3 + 5`
    *   Result: `8`
*   *Example:* Evaluate `2m - 1` if `m = 4`.
    *   Substitute `4` for `m`: `2(4) - 1` (Remember `2m` means `2 × m`)
    *   Calculate: `8 - 1`
    *   Result: `7`

**Key Takeaway for Lesson 1.2:**
Algebraic expressions combine numbers, variables, and operations. We can translate word phrases into these expressions.
