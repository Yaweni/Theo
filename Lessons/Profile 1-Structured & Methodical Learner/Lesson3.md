## Lesson 1.3: Why Variables are Powerful (Simple Problem Solving)

**1. Review: What Variables and Expressions Do**

*   **Variables** (like `x`, `y`) are placeholders for numbers.
*   **Algebraic Expressions** (like `x + 5`, `3y - 2`) combine variables, numbers, and operations to describe quantities.

**2. Using Variables to Model Real-World Situations**

The real power of variables comes when we use them to represent unknown quantities in problems and then set up equations to solve them. For now, let's focus on just setting up the expressions.

*   **Situation 1: Cost Calculation**
    *   *Problem:* Apples cost $2 each. If you buy some apples, what expression represents the total cost?
    *   *Step 1: Define a variable.* Let `a` be the number of apples you buy.
    *   *Step 2: Write the expression.* The total cost is `2 × a` (or `2a`).
    *   *If you buy 5 apples (`a=5`):* Cost = `2 × 5 = $10`.
    *   *If you buy 10 apples (`a=10`):* Cost = `2 × 10 = $20`.
    The variable `a` makes the calculation flexible.

*   **Situation 2: Age Differences**
    *   *Problem:* Tom is 5 years older than his sister, Jane. If Jane's age is unknown, write an expression for Tom's age.
    *   *Step 1: Define a variable.* Let `j` be Jane's age in years.
    *   *Step 2: Write the expression.* Tom's age is `j + 5`.
    *   *If Jane is 8 years old (`j=8`):* Tom's age = `8 + 5 = 13` years.
    *   *If Jane is 12 years old (`j=12`):* Tom's age = `12 + 5 = 17` years.

**3. Setting the Stage for Solving Equations**

While we are not solving full equations yet, understanding how to write expressions is the first crucial step.

*   Consider the problem: "A number increased by 7 is equal to 15. What is the number?"
    *   *Step 1: Define a variable.* Let `n` be the unknown number.
    *   *Step 2: Write the expression for "a number increased by 7".* This is `n + 7`.
    *   *Step 3: Form the equation.* The problem states this expression "is equal to 15." So, `n + 7 = 15`.
    (Later, you'll learn how to find that `n = 8`).

**4. The Power of Generalization**

Variables allow us to write general rules and solve many similar problems without starting from scratch each time.
*   The formula `Area = length × width` (or `A = lw`) for a rectangle works for *any* rectangle. We don't need a new rule for every different sized rectangle. This is the power of using variables to generalize.

**Key Takeaway for Lesson 1.3:**
Variables are powerful because they allow us to model real-world situations, represent unknown quantities, and create general formulas, which are the first steps toward solving algebraic problems.
