## Lesson 3.2: Building with Variables - Creating Math Phrases

Okay, so variables (like `x` or `y`) are our mystery boxes or placeholders. Now, let's see how we combine them with numbers and actions (like adding or subtracting) to make **algebraic expressions**.

Think of it like building with LEGOs:
*   **Numbers (2, 5, 10) are like specific LEGO bricks.**
*   **Variables (`x`, `y`) are like special LEGO bricks that can change shape or size (representing different numbers).**
*   **Operations (`+`, `-`, `×`) are how you connect the bricks.**

An **algebraic expression** is what you build – a combination of these pieces. It *doesn't* have an equals sign.

**Let's Translate Pictures & Words into Expressions:**

1.  **"You have a box `x` and you add 3 more items."**
    *   `[Imagine: Box 'x' alongside 3 separate dots (items).]`
    *   **Expression:** `x + 3`

2.  **"There are `b` birds in a tree. 2 fly away."**
    *   `[Imagine: A tree with 'b' bird shapes. An arrow shows 2 birds flying off.]`
    *   **Expression:** `b - 2`

3.  **"You have 4 bags. Each bag contains `m` marbles."**
    *   `[Imagine: 4 small bags, each labeled 'm marbles inside'.]`
    *   **Expression:** `4 × m` (or just `4m`)

4.  **"A pizza is cut into `p` slices. You and 2 friends (3 people total) share it equally."**
    *   `[Imagine: A pizza diagram divided into 'p' slices, with 3 stick figures around it.]`
    *   **Expression:** `p / 3` (each person gets `p` divided by 3 slices)

**Seeing an Expression in Action (If We Know What's in the Box):**

*   If our expression is `x + 3`, and we find out the box `x` actually holds the number `5`...
    *   `[Imagine: Box 'x' opens to show the number 5 inside.]`
    *   Then `x + 3` becomes `5 + 3`, which is `8`.
*   If our expression is `4m`, and each bag `m` has `10` marbles...
    *   `[Imagine: One bag 'm' opens to show 10 marbles.]`
    *   Then `4m` becomes `4 × 10`, which is `40` marbles total.

Expressions are like a recipe or a set of instructions using our variable "mystery boxes."
