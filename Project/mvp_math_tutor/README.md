# MVP: AI-Personalized Math Tutor

This project is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for an AI-Personalized Math Tutor web application.
It aims to demonstrate the core value proposition:
*   Assesses a user's cognitive traits through a short, interactive quiz.
*   Generates a simplified "Learner Profile" based on the assessment.
*   Delivers a segment of an Algebra lesson in a style demonstrably tailored to that Learner Profile.

1.  Ensure you have Python installed.
2.  Create a virtual environment (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  Run the Streamlit application:
