## Lesson 2.2: Crafting with Variables - The Language of Algebra

If variables are the nouns of algebra, then **algebraic expressions** are like its phrases or sentences. They're combinations of variables, numbers (constants), and mathematical operations (`+`, `-`, `×`, `÷`, exponents, etc.) that describe a quantity or a calculation.

**The Art of Translation: From Words to Expressions**

The real magic begins when we translate everyday language or problem statements into the concise language of algebraic expressions. It's like being a code-breaker!

*   **"A number, let's call it `q`, is increased by the square of another number, `p`."**
    *   This translates to: `q + p²`

*   **"The total value if you have `d` dimes (worth $0.10 each) and `n` nickels (worth $0.05 each)."**
    *   This becomes: `0.10d + 0.05n` (Notice how variables can represent distinct quantities).

*   **"Imagine a recipe needs `c` cups of flour. You decide to make half a batch."**
    *   The amount of flour needed is now: `(1/2)c` or `c/2`.

**Why are Expressions Useful Before We Even Solve Anything?**

1.  **Modeling & Representation:** Expressions allow us to create a mathematical model of a situation. This model itself can give us insights, even before we plug in specific numbers.
    *   For example, in `0.10d + 0.05n`, we can immediately see that dimes contribute more per coin to the total value than nickels.

2.  **Foundation for Equations:** An expression describes "what." An equation (which has an equals sign) makes a statement that "this expression is equal to that value/expression." You can't build solid equations without understanding how to build expressions first.
    *   If we say the total value of the coins from above *is* $2.50, then our expression becomes part of an equation: `0.10d + 0.05n = 2.50`.

**Playing with Expressions: Substitution**

Once you have an expression, if you *know* the values of the variables, you can substitute them in to find the expression's current numerical value.

*   Consider the expression for the area of a trapezoid: `(1/2) × (base1 + base2) × height`.
    Let `b1`, `b2`, and `h` be the variables.
    If `b1 = 5`, `b2 = 7`, and `h = 4`:
    Area = `(1/2) × (5 + 7) × 4 = (1/2) × 12 × 4 = 6 × 4 = 24`.

The beauty of the expression is its generality; it works for any trapezoid!
