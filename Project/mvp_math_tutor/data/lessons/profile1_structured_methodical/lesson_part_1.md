## Lesson 1.1: What is a Variable? A Step-by-Step Guide

**1. Definition: What is a Variable?**

*   In mathematics, particularly in Algebra, a **variable** is a symbol used to represent a number.
*   Most often, this symbol is a letter from the alphabet (like `x`, `y`, `a`, `b`, or `m`).
*   Think of a variable as a **placeholder** or a **container** for a numerical value. This value might be:
    *   Currently unknown (something we need to find out).
    *   Able to change or vary.

**2. Purpose: Why Do We Use Variables?**

We use variables for several key reasons:

*   **To represent unknown quantities:**
    *   *Example 1:* If a problem states, "Sarah has some apples. If she gets 2 more, she will have 5 apples in total." We can use a variable, say `x`, to represent the "some apples" Sarah initially had.
*   **To write general rules or formulas:**
    *   *Example 2:* The formula for the perimeter of a square is `4 × side_length`. We can write this as `P = 4s`, where `P` represents the perimeter and `s` represents the length of one side. This formula works for any square, no matter its size.
*   **To describe relationships between quantities that change together:**
    *   *Example 3:* If one movie ticket costs $10, the total cost for several tickets depends on how many tickets you buy. If `n` is the number of tickets, the total cost is `10 × n`.

**3. Identifying Variables:**

Look at these examples:

*   `a + 5 = 12` (Here, `a` is the variable)
*   `C = 2πr` (The formula for the circumference of a circle. `C` and `r` are variables; `π` (pi) is a constant, approximately 3.14159)
*   "John is 3 years older than his sister, Maria. If Maria's age is `m` years, then John's age is `m + 3` years." (Here, `m` is the variable representing Maria's age).

**Key Takeaway for Lesson 1.1:**
A variable is a letter (or symbol) that stands in for a number. It's a fundamental building block in Algebra.
